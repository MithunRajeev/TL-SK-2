## 1. Introduction

Electromagnetic wave propagation in waveguides is a fundamental subject in microwave engineering. Among the simplest waveguide structures is the parallel plate waveguide, consisting of two infinite, perfectly conducting plates separated by a fixed distance. Though impractical for real-world systems due to lack of lateral confinement, the parallel plate waveguide is an ideal theoretical model to explore wave propagation principles, particularly for Transverse Electric (TE) and Transverse Magnetic (TM) modes.

This report investigates how boundary conditions influence the propagation of TE and TM waves in such waveguides. We derive field expressions, examine cutoff frequencies, and analyze power flow with an emphasis on pure theory.



## 2. Basic Theory of Parallel Plate Waveguides

## 2.1 Geometry and Assumptions

The parallel plate waveguide consists of two infinitely large, perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance 'd' along the y-axis. The plates are parallel to the x-z plane, and electromagnetic waves are assumed to propagate along the z-direction. The waveguide supports time-harmonic electromagnetic fields, characterized by an angular frequency $\omega$. Due to the ideal conductor assumption, the tangential electric field at the surfaces of the plates must be zero.

## 2.2 Classification of Modes
In such a configuration, three primary types of wave modes can theoretically exist:

* **Transverse Electric (TE) Modes**: Electric field has no component in the direction of propagation ($E_z = 0$).
* **Transverse Magnetic (TM) Modes**: Magnetic field has no component in the direction of propagation ($H_z = 0$).
* **Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) Modes**: Both electric and magnetic fields are entirely transverse to the direction of propagation. However, a pure TEM mode cannot exist in a hollow parallel plate waveguide with a single conductor boundary, as it requires a return path which is absent in this configuration.

## 3. Derivation of Field Equations

## 3.1 Maxwell's Equations in Source-Free Regions

The wave equations are derived from Maxwell's curl equations under source-free, time-harmonic conditions:
$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -j\omega\mu \vec{H}, \quad \nabla \times \vec{H} = j\omega\varepsilon \vec{E}$
We assume field components vary with $e^{-j\beta z}$ to reflect propagation along the z-axis with propagation constant $\beta$.

## 3.2 TE Modes ($E_z = 0$)
For TE modes, the non-zero component $H_z$ satisfies:
$\frac{\partial^2 H_z}{\partial y^2} + \beta^2 H_z = 0$
Applying PEC boundary conditions ($E_y = 0$ at $y = 0$ and $y = d$) leads to:
$H_z = H_0 \cos\left(\frac{n\pi y}{d}\right) e^{-j\beta z}$
The cutoff frequency for TE modes is:
$f_{c,n} = \frac{n c}{2d}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$
where $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}}$.

## 3.3 TM Modes ($H_z = 0$)
For TM modes, the relevant component is $E_z$, which satisfies a similar differential equation with sine function solutions:
$E_z = E_0 \sin\left(\frac{n\pi y}{d}\right) e^{-j\beta z}$
The cutoff frequency for TM modes is also:
$f_{c,n} = \frac{n c}{2d}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$

## 4. Boundary Conditions and Their Implications

## 4.1 Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) Conditions
The electromagnetic fields must conform to specific conditions at the conductor surfaces:

* The **tangential component** of the electric field must be zero at the PEC boundaries:
  $E_y = 0 \quad \text{at} \quad y = 0, d$
* The **normal component** of the magnetic field must also vanish at the boundary, ensuring no flux penetration.

## 4.2 Impacts on Field Distribution

These boundary conditions lead to quantization of the permissible field configurations inside the waveguide. The y-dependent variations of $E_z$ or $H_z$ become sinusoidal, and the mode number $n$ denotes the number of half-wavelengths that fit between the plates. Higher order modes exhibit more complex field distributions, with increased numbers of peaks and nodes across the y-axis.

## 5. Power Flow Analysis Using Poynting Vector
The time-averaged power flow is given by the Poynting vector:

$$
\vec{S} = \frac{1}{2} \text{Re}(\vec{E} \times \vec{H}^*)
$$

For TE modes, the primary power flow component in the z-direction is:

$$
S_z = \frac{1}{2} \text{Re}(E_x H_y^*) = \frac{\beta}{2 \omega \mu} |H_z|^2
$$

This implies that the power carried is directly proportional to the square of the magnetic field amplitude and inversely proportional to $\omega\mu$. Near cutoff frequencies, $\beta$ becomes small, significantly reducing the power carried by the mode.

## 6. Limitations of Parallel Plate Waveguides

* **Infinite Width**: The assumption of infinite plate width is unrealistic in physical systems and ignores lateral effects.
* **No Lateral Confinement**: In practice, energy can diffract out of the sides, making the waveguide inefficient.
* **No TEM Mode Support**: Due to the absence of a return conductor, TEM propagation is impossible in this configuration.

## 7. Graphical Interpretation

## 7.1 Mode Shapes

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c91479-a7d0-4546-8a9d-42873c3c5267)

* **TE0 Mode**: Uniform or constant distribution of $H_z$ along the y-axis, typically not supported in standard waveguides due to boundary conditions.
* **TE1 Mode**: Exhibits a single peak (cosine distribution) of $H_z$ along the y-axis.
  Similar distributions exist for TM modes but with sine-shaped field profiles.

## 7.2 Dispersion Curves
The dispersion relation plots $\beta$ versus frequency for each mode. As frequency approaches the cutoff, $\beta \rightarrow 0$, and waves become non-propagating (evanescent). Above cutoff, $\beta$ increases with frequency, and waves exhibit normal dispersive behavior.

## 8. Summary
   This report presents a thorough theoretical analysis of TE and TM modes in an idealized parallel plate waveguide. By deriving field solutions and analyzing boundary conditions, the study demonstrates how the geometry enforces discrete mode structures and influences power transmission. Though the model lacks practical viability, it lays the groundwork for understanding more complex guided wave systems.
